# To all my team members
I created the Directory structure for temporary purpose. It will be changed according to the progress of our project.

# RULES
* Add a commit id to each and every commit you make in this repo.
* commit id = "NAME#your_nth_commit_number".

* Also note that, follow the same process while keeping the PR's.

* Dont forget to fork this repo and work on it.
* Create multiple branches so that you can work more efficiently.
* Make sure you always pull the changes made in the master repo.
* While coding, remember to add some comments so that it would be helpful to master repo when it merges the PR.
